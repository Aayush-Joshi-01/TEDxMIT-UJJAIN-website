## Tech Stack

The website is built using the following technologies:

1. **Frontend Framework**: React.js and its ecosystem, including HTML and CSS for the user interface.
2. **Build Tool**: Vite.js for fast and efficient development.
3. **Module Bundler**: Rollup for bundling JavaScript modules.
4. **Linter**: Eslint for code quality and consistency.
5. **Configuration**: jsconfig.json for project configuration.
6. **Hosting**: The website is hosted on Vercel.
7. **SSL Certification**: The website has SSL certification to ensure secure connections.

## Website Structure

The website is organized into two major pages:

### Main Page

- **Home**: The landing page that provides an overview of the TEDxMITUjjain event.
- **About**: Information about the event, its mission, and its organizers.
- **Speakers**: Details about the featured speakers who will be presenting at the event.

## How to Run Locally

While the website is already hosted, if you want to run the project locally for development purposes, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Node.js installed (version 16.0.0 or higher).
3. Open your terminal, navigate to the project directory, and run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Run `npm run dev` to start a local development server. Vite.js provides hot module replacement, so you don't need to manually refresh the site during development.
